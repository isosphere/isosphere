I'm a software developer that cares about computing under uncertainty. 

I've become a Rust fanboy because `rustc` and `clippy` make my code drastically easier to maintain. Previously I stuck to Python, and Perl before that.

As a software developer I have:
* built a responsive WASM application that [tracks power outages in Nova Scotia](https://outages.dataheck.com)
* built a data collection, reporting, and analysis backend for the financial trading side of [an expert in the meat and livestock industry](https://jsferraro.com/)
* architected a custom CRM for a client's physical meat business
* built monitoring software polling a campus of environmental monitoring devices for [Sanofi Pasteur](https://www.sanofi.ca/en/) in Toronto, Canada
* produced software compatible with closed, proprietary protocols in the Building Automation industry

Most of my repositories are private, unfortunately.

I run a [Mastodon instance for Atlantic Canada](https://oceanplayground.social/).

## Hiring

I am available for contract work; my principal customers are small businesses that rely heavily on Excel and manual data manipulation. I automate their processes to ensure that their data is serving them, rather than the other way around. I operate under the pseudonym [Data Heck](https://www.dataheck.com).
