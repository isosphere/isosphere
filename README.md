I build automation to eliminate repetitive tasks—if it saves someone a weekly click, I'll spend the day coding it.
Solo web developer focused on reliable, performant solutions. Current stack: Debian, PostgreSQL, Rust, WASM.

# Language Journey:

- C → Memory management and safety fundamentals
- Perl → Regular expressions and documentation practices
- Python → Rapid prototyping and iteration
- Rust → Type-safe productivity with compiler-enforced reliability

I value code that works predictably and systems that respect both user time and developer sanity.
