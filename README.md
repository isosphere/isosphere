I'll work all day if it means someone doesn't have to click something once a week.  

Most of my work has been building web things as a solo dev. My current stack for projects is Debian, PostgreSQL, Rust, WASM.

My first language was C, then paid my way through university[^1] with Perl. Switched to Python for years, and recently switched to Rust. 

[^1]: BEng Mechanical Engineering

C taught me respect for memory allocation and safety. 
Perl taught me the power of regular expressions and in-file documentation. 
Python taught me how to move fast and build things.
Rust taught me how productive it is to build on trust backed by a picky compiler.
