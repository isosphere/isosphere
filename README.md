I'm a software developer that hates friction. 

Some things I've built:

* a data collection, reporting, and analysis backend for a professional speculator in the meat and livestock futures market
* a WASM application that [tracks power outages in Nova Scotia](https://outages.dataheck.com)
* the schema for a physical meat business bespoke CRM build (goals: recommendations, bid/ask order book, inventory management via automated sales)
* bespoke monitoring and alarming software for environmental sensors across a pharmaceutical campus
* software compatiblity layers for closed, undocumented, proprietary protocols
