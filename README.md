I'm a software developer that cares about **computing under uncertainty**. I love Rust for its **safety guarentees**, and the Bayesian statistical
approach for the **clarity** of its outputs. I believe in **clear communication** and **useful documentation**. I am a capable Linux and Windows server administrator and have a good understanding of networking. 

As a software developer I have:
* built a responsive WASM application that [tracks power outages in Nova Scotia](https://outages.dataheck.com)
* built a data collection, reporting, and analysis backend for the financial trading side of [an expert in the meat and livestock industry](https://jsferraro.com/)
* architected a custom CRM for the above client's physical meat business
* built monitoring software polling a campus of environmental monitoring devices for [Sanofi Pasteur](https://www.sanofi.ca/en/) in Toronto, Canada
* produced software compatible with closed, proprietary protocols in the Building Automation industry (via protocol reverse engineering)
* professionally written software in C, JavaScript, Perl, Python, ASP.NET, and PHP
* personally written software in Rust, assembly (68HC11, AVR), TypeScript, and .NET

Most of my repositories are private, unfortunately.
