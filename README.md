### Hi there, I'm Matt! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer that cares about uncertainty in data and life in general. I love Rust for its safety guarentees, and the Bayesian statistical
approach for its focus on (un)certainty distributions.

I built the data collection, reporting, and analysis backend for a family office that trades livestock futures. I traded futures
myself with a macro-based strategy that I ultimately abandoned following a failure to reject the null hypothesis using a Bayesian 
estimation technique. I have learned that backtests should occur after statistical tests, and am trying to spread that message via 
the [@confirmsignal](https://twitter.com/confirmsignal) handle on Twitter.

I summarized my life story at [my website](https://matthewscheffel.com).
