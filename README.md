I'll work all day if it means someone doesn't have to click something once a week.  

TL;DR my experience: learned C at 13, then used Perl professionally through university[^1], switched to Python, and recently switched to Rust. 

[^1]: BEng Mechanical Engineering

C taught me respect for memory allocation and safety. 
Perl taught me the power of regular expressions and in-file documentation. 
Python taught me how to move fast and build things.
Rust taught me how productive it is to build on trust.

Most of my work has been building web things as a solo dev. My current stack for projects is Debian, PostgreSQL, Rust, WASM.
