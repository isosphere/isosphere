I'm a software developer that cares about computing under uncertainty. 

Rust has become my primary language because `rustc` and `clippy` make my code drastically easier to maintain. Previously I stuck to Python, and Perl before that.

As a software developer I have:
* built a responsive WASM application that [tracks power outages in Nova Scotia](https://outages.dataheck.com) (server is underpowered and overloaded as of this writing)
* built a data collection, reporting, and analysis backend for the financial trading side of [an expert in the meat and livestock industry](https://jsferraro.com/)
* architected a custom CRM for a client's physical meat business
* built monitoring software polling a campus of environmental monitoring devices for [Sanofi Pasteur](https://www.sanofi.ca/en/) in Toronto, Canada
* produced software compatible with closed, proprietary protocols in the Building Automation industry

## New Clients

I am available for contract work; my customers are small businesses that rely on Excel and manual data manipulation/entry. I automate their processes to ensure that their data is serving them - too many serve their data. 

I operate under [Data Heck](https://www.dataheck.com).
