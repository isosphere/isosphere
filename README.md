I'll work all day if it means someone doesn't have to click something once a week.  

TL;DR my career: learned C at 13, learned and used Perl professionally through university[^1], switched to Python, switched to Rust around 2020. 

[^1]: BEng Mechanical Engineering

Most of my work has been building web things as a solo dev. My current stack for projects is Debian, PostgreSQL, Rust, WASM.

C taught me respect for memory allocation and safety. 
Perl taught me regular expressions and in-file documentation. 
Python taught me how to move fast and build things.
Rust taught me how productive it is to build on bedrock instead of sand.
