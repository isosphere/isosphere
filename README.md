I'm a software developer that cares about **computing under uncertainty**. I love Rust for its **safety guarentees**, and the Bayesian statistical
approach for the **clarity** of its outputs. I believe in **clear communication** and **useful documentation**. I handle my own devops, and I 
provision my own servers. 

As a software developer I have:
* built a responsive WASM application that [tracks power outages in Nova Scotia](https://outages.dataheck.com)
* built a data collection, reporting, and analysis backend for a proprietary trading office
* designed a custom CRM for a participant in the meat industry
* built monitoring software polling a campus of environmental monitoring devices for Sanofi Pasteur in Toronto, Canada
* produced software that communicates with closed, proprietary protocols via reverse engineering

As a trader I have learned that backtests sample across a single happenstance path and that the universe of counterfactual paths must be considered. In other words, past performance is not indicitive of future results. I am trying to spread that message via the [@confirmsignal](https://twitter.com/confirmsignal) handle on Twitter.
