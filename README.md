### Hi there, I'm Matt! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught software developer that cares about certainty and uncertainty in data and life in general. I built the data collection,
reporting, and analysis backend for a family office that trades livestock futures. I traded futures myself with a macro-based strategy
that I ultimately abandoned following a failure to reject the null hypothesis using a Bayesian estimation technique. I have learned that
backtests should occur after statistical tests, and am trying to spread that message via the [@confirmsignal](https://twitter.com/confirmsignal) handle on Twitter.

I summarized my life story at [my website](https://matthewscheffel.com), and I also have a blog there where I write existential thoughts.
